<!--This code is the layout for each blog post. It takes the post title and 
image, then uses the main BaseLayout around everything. Inside the page, 
it shows the title on top, the post text in the slot, and the image on the 
side (only if it exists). Basically, it makes all my blog posts have the same 
clean structure. -->

<BaseLayout title={title}>
  <section class="post-layout">
    <div class="post-container">

      <h1 class="post-title">{title}</h1>

      <article class="post-body">
        <slot />
      </article>

      {image && (
        <img src={image} alt={title} class="post-image" />
      )}
